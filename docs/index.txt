:mod:`cli` provides a suite of tools that simplify the process of
developing testable, robust and easy-to-use command line applications.
With :mod:`cli`, your scripts (and larger applications) can use Python's
extensive standard library to parse configuration files and command line
parameters, log messages and even daemonize. All of these services are
made available through the :class:`Application` class, an instance of
which is passed to your script at run time. Even though it is
featureful, :mod:`cli` is decidedly unmagical.
