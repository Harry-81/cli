CLI: Makes CLI easier for Python
================================

Overview
========

The CLI App classes (hereafter 'App') try to make writing command
line applications in Python less boring by handling the obvious and
easy bits. Let App parse options and arguments, read configuration
files, interpret the environment and build a logger for you!

App makes writing easy to use scripts as simple as defining a
function::

    def helloworld(app, *args, **kwargs):
        print 'hello world.'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from cli import App

        app = App(helloworld)
        app.run()

If you save that in 'helloworld.py' and run it, you should get the
following:

    $ python ./helloworld.py
    hello world.

But there's more! App automatically created an option parser (using
Python's standard optparse package) for you::

    $ python ./helloworld.py -h
    Usage: helloworld 

    Options:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit

As we proceed, you'll find out that App did a few more things behind
the scenes for you, too, but it's worth investigating the option
parsing in greater depth first.
