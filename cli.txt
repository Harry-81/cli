CLI: Makes CLI easier for Python
================================

:author: Will Maier <will@m.aier.us>

Overview
========

The classes provided by the CLI module make command line programs
easier to write in Python. Where once you might have instantiated
your own optparse.OptionParser, ConfigParser.ConfigParser and
logging.Logger, the App* classes handle all of that for you and
provide reasonable defaults while doing it. For example::

    def main(app, x, y, **kwargs):
        """calculate the sum of two arguments."""
        print('x + y: %d' % x + y)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from cli import App

        app = App('summer')
        app.run()

That's it! In the App world, command line options, settings found in
configuration files and even environment variables are boiled down
into standard Python arguments and keyword arguments passed to a
main() function that you define. In addition, you have access to the
App object itself, which can provide more functionality (like
logging).

Option Parsing
==============

App uses Python's standard optparse package to parse options and
arguments on the command line.
